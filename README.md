# Dynamic-Stopper
Dynamic Stopper extends Spotâ€™s Autowalk missions with runtime control: pause every X meters, sidestep laterally, capture images, and run background tasks (e.g., YOLO detection). Unlike fixed paths, it injects dynamic maneuvers into recorded routes, while GraphNav keeps the robot localized and obstacle-aware.
